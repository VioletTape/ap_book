| **TIER**           | **DESCRIPTION**                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Domain**         | A direct model of business objects applicable to the whole domain. Independent of individual applications and data sources.                                                                                                                    |
| **Application logic** | A selection and simplification of the domain model for an application. Contains no user interface code but provides a set of facades of the domain tiers for the user interface. Converts from rich domain tier types to the types required by a presentation. |
| **Presentation**   | Performs the formatting of information from the application facade into a GUI or paper report. Is only concerned with user interface, and has no knowledge of underlying domain tier.                                                        |
| **Data interface** | Responsible for moving information between data sources and the domain tier. Will provide a simple interface broker for the domain tier to issue requests. Has visibility of both the domain tier and the data sources. Will be divided into subsystems based on the type of data sources used. |
